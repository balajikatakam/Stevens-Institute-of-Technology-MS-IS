# Classification
Write a classification script named 'classifier.py' that trains on reviews_train.txt and achieves the maximum possible accuracy on reviews_test.txt. 

You can use any type of classifier that you want.

You get 1 points for every extra 1 % over 85%. For example, if you get an accuracy of 90%, you will get 5 points.
