# Predicting the Rotten tomatoes Score and Audience Score for a movie based on the scraped data from Rotten Tomatoes
# BIA-660-A Web Analytics Final Project

Initially we scraped over 14,000 movies on Rottentomatoes.com to create a DataSet.
Used Deep Learning and Regression based predictive models to accurately predict these scores.

Your task is to build a regression model that can accurately predict the gap between the average audience rating and the average critic rating for a movie.

- You will train your model on data collected from rottentomatoes. You can collect as much data as you want.

- Your model will be tested on a separate dataset that you will not have access to. This testing set will also be collected from rottentomatoes.

- Your model can utilize any features that you think can explain the rating gap.

- This is a team a project.
